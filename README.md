# 3D World Generation Prototype

This repository is an experimental prototype inspired by [Meta's WorldGen](https://www.meta.com/blog/worldgen-3d-world-generation-reality-labs-generative-ai-research/?srsltid=AfmBOorIoH7ATPoMZ5tp-T7wrlDw2T0BUl8v_h3YXHCOOVUGG4rb5c4A), a research project from Meta Reality Labs.

**About WorldGen**  
WorldGen is Meta’s generative AI system for 3D world creation, capable of building rich, dynamic, Minecraft-style environments using a hybrid approach of reinforcement learning and generative models. According to the [official blog post](https://www.meta.com/blog/worldgen-3d-world-generation-reality-labs-generative-ai-research/?srsltid=AfmBOorIoH7ATPoMZ5tp-T7wrlDw2T0BUl8v_h3YXHCOOVUGG4rb5c4A):

- **WorldGen** can generate hundreds of square kilometers of surface area per second at Minecraft’s scale and density, on a single GPU.
- It is designed to enable large-scale, procedural environments useful for research and experimentation in areas such as AI agents, robotics, and generative modeling.
- The generated worlds can include structures, objects, and terrain, and are customizable via parameters or prompts.
- The system aims to lower the barrier for researchers looking for complex, interactive 3D environments without manual world-building.

**Our Goals**  
This project is a prototype inspired by WorldGen. Our objectives are:

- To explore open-ended, AI-driven creation of vast 3D worlds.
- To experiment with procedurally generated terrain, objects, and structures using generative AI.
- To create a testbed for future research in reinforcement learning, world modeling, and embodied AI.

**Status**  
This is an early-stage prototype for exploration and learning. All feedback, suggestions, and collaborations are welcome!
